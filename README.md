 c205 Week 04:
=======
  * `quiz.c` let you redo the quiz we did today! Compile and run it, and you can test if you can redo the quiz correctly.
  * `e2x.c` is a program to compute e^x which heap of comments and questions and answers. Just skim it. I hope that you will spend only one minute to read it and then say: "Rubbish, I knew all of these things!".

HOWTO download this repository to your computer:

If you just want a single file, say, `prog.c`:
  * Click on `prog.c` and you will see its content 
  * Copy the content and paste into your jEdit/editor window, then save it in your working folder

If you want to download the whole directory:
  * Download this whole directory by clicking `Clone or Download` --> `Download ZIP`, it will normally be downloaded to your `Downloads` folder under the name `c205-master` or `c205-master.ZIP`
  * Then copy or move the folder `c205-master` from `Downloads` to under your working folder
  * If the downloaded `c205-master` has the extension `.ZIP`, you likely need to expand the zipped file with command `unzip c205-master.ZIP`. If the command doesn't work, ask Google how to unzip.
