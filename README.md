=======

anagram_e7.15.c
---------------
a skeleton for writing string function such as ex 7.15, ex 7.14, ex 7.12 (palindrome)

structs.c and students.txt
--------------------------
a simple program and data for reading and storing a list of student records.
For simplicity, each student record has only 3 component: student ID, ATAR score, and year of entering the university.

After compiling, you can run the program with:
`./structs < students.txt`

Can you add another field for student first name? Can you sort the array (in any order you wish)?
