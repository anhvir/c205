--------------
Notes and advices on assignments 1, including the submission process.

structs.c and students.txt
--------------------------
a simple program and data for reading and storing a list of student records.
For simplicity, each student record has only 3 component: student ID, ATAR score, and year of entering the university.

After compiling, you can run the program with:

./structs < students.txt

in this case the program will run with data read from the file "students.txt" instead of from the keyboard. You also can do:

./structs < students.txt > structs.out

in this case, the output will be written to the file "structs.out" instead of to the computer's display.

coin_change.c
-------------
An array-based solution to Exercise 6.9
 Part 1 (ie not considering coins $1, $2). You need to implement 
change_one_coin, try the program and understand it.

array.c
-------  
Simple examples on using arrays, can be used as skeleton for exercises 7.3 and 7.4.
