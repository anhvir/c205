Assignment 1 will be likely released this week.
During the 2 week break, Anh will open some Zoom/grok sessions for
consultation. Please watch this place for planned time slots.

Main Tasks this week:
-------------
  * Do all exercises in `grok`, W5, then W4 (with additional requirement of using functions when possible), then W5X and W4X (with using functions).



If the exercies seem too difficult, explore:
--------------------------
(note: the following files have been changed from last week):
  * **quiz.c** let you redo the quiz week 4! 
In comparison with last week, the program was
rewritten using functions.

  * **e2x.c** is a completed program to compute e^x, with heap of explanation. Run and explore it to see some decisions in designing the code. 
   Again, the program has been rewritten with using functions.

 

------------------------------------------------------
HOWTO download this repository to your computer:

If you just want a single file, say, `e2x.c`:
  * Click `e2x.c` and you will see its markup content
  * Click `Raw` to get the coresponding text-only content 
  * Copy the content and paste into your grok/jEdit window


If you want to download the whole directory:
  * Download this whole directory by clicking `Clone or Download` --> `Download ZIP`, it will normally be downloaded to your `Downloads` folder under the name `c205-master` or `c205-master.ZIP`
  * Then copy or move the folder `c205-master` from `Downloads` to under your working folder
  * If the downloaded `c205-master` has the extension `.ZIP`, you likely need to expand the zipped file with command `unzip c205-master.ZIP`. If the command doesn't work, ask Google how to unzip.
