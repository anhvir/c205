1. Click [here](./quiz.c) for a version `.c` for running quiz. Note that 
it's totally different from the one described last week.
Actually,  **quiz.c** let you redo the quiz we did today! Compile and run it, and you can test

For a teaching week, a new content is (normally) uploaded at the very beginning of the week, and that content is removed one week later.

HOWTO download this repository to your computer:

If you just want a single file, say, `quiz.c`:
  * Click `quiz.c` and you will see its markup content
  * Click `Raw` to get the corresponding text-only content 
  * Copy the content and paste into your grok/jEdit window


If you want to download the whole directory:
  * Download this whole directory by clicking `Clone or Download` --> `Download ZIP`, it will normally be downloaded to your `Downloads` folder under the name `c205-master` or `c205-master.ZIP`
  * Then copy or move the folder `c205-master` from `Downloads` to under your working folder
  * If the downloaded `c205-master` has the extension `.ZIP`, you likely need to expand the zipped file with command `unzip c205-master.ZIP`. If the command doesn't work, ask Google how to unzip.
