 c205 Week 03 Lab
=======
Main tasks: 
----------- 
The following tasks are available in **`grok`**, and could be coveniently implemented
using **`grok`**. You are encouraged to implement them using **`jEdit/gcc`**.
  * Implement ex. 3.6, then ask one of the tutors for any possible improvement. 
  * Implement ex 3.7. Read the task, and at first ask yourself: How many input data are needed? How many output data? What is the data type for each of them?

Additional Tasks
----------------
  * *unserstanding* **`scanf:`** Use file **`scanf_test.c`** to play a bit (by running it with suggested or some odd inputs and try to understand the output).
  * Implement a program that prints out the minimal and maximal value of 3 real numbers. To save your time, use the supplied file min_max.c as a starting point. 
  * **`equation2.c`** is an unfinished program to solve equation ax+b=0. Change it so that:
    * It can be compiled without any warnings/errors
    * It also works when one of, or both, `a` and `b` receive zero value
  * Still have time? Use **`equation2.c`** as a starting point, implement a program that prints out all real solutions of quadratic equation `ax^2 + bx + c = 0` (this problem is the same as Exercise 3.3).
  * Try other exercises in Chapter 3 of the text book.

HOWTO download this repository to your computer (for use with **`jEdit/gcc`**:

If you just want a single file, say, `prog.c`:
  * Click on `prog.c` and you will see its content 
  * Copy the content and paste into your jEdit/editor window, then save it in your working folder

If you want to download the whole directory:
  * Download this whole directory by clicking `Clone or Download` --> `Download ZIP`, it will normally be downloaded to your `Downloads` folder under the name `c205-master` or `c205-master.ZIP`
  * Then copy or move the folder `c205-master` from `Downloads` to under your working folder
  * If the downloaded `c205-master` has the extension `.ZIP`, you likely need to expand the zipped file with command `unzip c205-master.ZIP`. If the command doesn't work, ask Google how to unzip.
