 c205 Week 03:
=======
The tasks today:
  * Mandatory task: implement ex. 3.6, then ask one of the tutors for any possible improvement. Still don't have textbook? Click on `book_exercises.pdf` but note that you have to rely on textbook from next workshop.
  * Another task: implement ex 3.7. Read the task, and at first ask yourself: How many input data are needed? How many output data? What is the data type for each of them?
  * Still confused with `scanf`? Use file `scanf_test.c` to play a bit (by running it with some odd data and try to understand the output).
  * Implement a program that prints out the minimal and maximal value of 3 real numbers. To save your time, use the supplied file min_max.c as a starting point. 
  * `equation2.c` is an unfinished program to solve equation ax+b=0. Change it so that:
    * It can be compiled without any warnings/errors
    * It also works when one of, or both, `a` and `b` receive zero value
  * Still have time? Use equation2.c as a starting point, do exercise 3.03 in grok C03.
  * Finish other exercises of grok C03
  * Try exercise 4.03 in grok C04

HOWTO download this repository to your computer:

If you just want a single file, say, `prog.c`:
  * Click on `prog.c` and you will see its content 
  * Copy the content and paste into your jEdit/editor window, then save it in your working folder

If you want to download the whole directory:
  * Download this whole directory by clicking `Clone or Download` --> `Download ZIP`, it will normally be downloaded to your `Downloads` folder under the name `c205-master` or `c205-master.ZIP`
  * Then copy or move the folder `c205-master` from `Downloads` to under your working folder
  * If the downloaded `c205-master` has the extension `.ZIP`, you likely need to expand the zipped file with command `unzip c205-master.ZIP`. If the command doesn't work, ask Google how to unzip.
