 c205 Week 02: Start your lab with login into `grok` and do the exercises there first.
=======

If you don't know how to use `grok`
---------------------------------
1. Open a new tab in your browser and login into `grok` --> `comp20005`  
1. Do exercise 1.02 (heloworld). If you don't see the exercise, click on the symbol on the left of `Instructions`, then choose `Exercise 1.02` under `W02 Week 2 Workshop`. You will see the problem 1.02 in the left windows. To do exercise 1.02:
   1. Type your program on the right window
   1. Click on `Run` to run your program
   1. If you see any error message, try to understand and fix it, then go back to the previous step
   1. If your program runs, click on `Mark` to have the program marked automatically, then continue to edit/run/mark until getting the correct output.
1. If you still have difficulty in using `grok`, have a look at `Canvas` --> `Working with grok, jEdit, and gcc` --> `Guide to Using grok`
1. Do exercise 2.08 
1. Do exercise 2.04. 
1. Try guessNumber.c, then explained_guessNumber.c


The best way of using this page with `grok`
--------------------------------------------
  * Click on individual .c file, such as guessNumber.c
  * Then, when you see the content of the file, click on Raw
  * Now, you are seeing the text version of the file, copy it using Ctrl-A then Ctrl-C
  * Paste the copied content to the PlayGround of `grok`
  * Run, mark, modify, rerun, ... 

The best way to use this page with `jEdit`/`minGW`
--------------------------------------------------
  * Download this whole **c205** directory by clicking **Clone or Download** --> **Download ZIP**, it will normally be downloaded to your **Downloads** directory
  * Then copy the directory **c205** from **Downloads** to your working directory
  * Now use `jEdit` and `gcc` to edit and try the program (if you haven't 
installed jEdit/gcc in your laptop, do it at home and try at home)
  * Note that *explained_guessNumber.c* is the same as *guessNumber.c*, but also has heap of explainations, but don't try hard to understand everything 
  * Repair and complete *equation.c* if you haven't done so 

Important Homework
-----------------
1. If you haven't installed minGW/jEdit on your laptop, do it at home ASAP and within this week. Instruction for installation is available in Canvas: 
`Canvas` -->  `Working with grok, jEdit, and gcc` --> `Install gcc and jEdit on Your Own Computer`
