c205 Week 08:
=======

For this week, main topics include structs and arrays of structs. 

e89_skeleton.c and e89.data
---------------------------
Skeleton and input data for a simplified version of exercise 8.9.
You can use it to do the implementation of e8.9 in around 10 min.

e89_finished.c
--------------
A full implementation of the simplified e8.9, with heap of explanation.
You should have a look at that only if you find that you still have
some problems with using structs.

You can gcc, and then run this program with:

e89_finished < ./e89.data  


09_C205_18S1.pdf
