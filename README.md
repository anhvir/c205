 c205 Week 04:
=======
  * **quiz.c** might be interesting! Compile and run it, and you can test
if you fully understood some of the quizs we did today.
  * **guessNumber.c** was revised for this week. It now can read a name containg more than 1 word. NOTE: it still require us to enter a number for the next input, and if you try to type in some **letters** instead of **digits* the program still fails.
  Can we deal with that? Of course yet, but it's a bit complicated for now, and is not worth to invest our time here. Final dot for guessNumber.c.

  * e2x.c is the same as it was last week, but I added the answers to all questions!!!
