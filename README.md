 c205 Week 10:
=======
The tasks today:
-----------------
  * Work on assignment 2. For starting, make sure to copy the skeleton from the FAQ, sign it, and save it as your first draff of assignemnt2.c. It's not too ambitious to have a goal of `finishing stage 1 and get 9 marks` today!
  * But, make sure that you understand the task fully. If in doubt, ask questions.
  * Alternatively, you can do one or both tasks listed below. 
  * Task 1: implement `ex. 8.9` or a simplified version of it. For a simplified version, you can use the attached skeleton `e89_skeleton.c` as the start. Or, if you want just to have a quick check, have a look as solution `e89_finished.c`.  
  * Task 2: use struct to implement polygons in exercises `8.2-8.4`. Note that `polygon_no_struct.c` provided in this site is an array-based and incoplete version for this task. That `polygon_no_struct.c` is just a solution to an in-class workshop exercise we did about 3 weeks ago.

The supplied files:
------------------
  * `e89_skeleton.c` is a skeleton for a simplified version of exercise 8.9
  * `e89_finished.c` is a solution for the above skeleton, with heap of (hepefully unnecessary) comments.
  * `e89_data.txt` is a sample data set for `e89_finished.c`. You can try with `./e89_finished < e89_data.txt`
  * `polygon_no_struct.c` is a solution to our past class exercise, which represents a polygon as a pair of array and a buddy variable `n`.
  * `polygon_data.txt` is a sample data set for the polygon program above. Usage: `./polygon_no_struct < polygon_data.txt`

HOWTO download this repository to your computer:

If you just want a single file, say, `prog.c`:
  * Click on `prog.c` and you will see its content 
  * Copy the content and paste into your jEdit/editor window, then save it in your working folder

If you want to download the whole directory:
  * Download this whole directory by clicking `Clone or Download` --> `Download ZIP`, it will normally be downloaded to your `Downloads` folder under the name `c205-master` or `c205-master.ZIP`
  * Then copy or move the folder `c205-master` from `Downloads` to under your working folder
  * If the downloaded `c205-master` has the extension `.ZIP`, you likely need to expand the zipped file with command `unzip c205-master.ZIP`. If the command doesn't work, ask Google how to unzip.
