 c205 Week 04
=======
Main Tasks:
-------------
  * Do all exercises in `grok`, in cluding extra exercises in `W4E`
  

Additional Tasks (in decreasing order of importance):
-------------------
  * **quiz.c** let you redo the quiz we did today! Compile and run it, and you can test
if you fully understood the quiz. Then explore it to see how it works.

  * **e2x.c** is a completed program to compute e^x, with heap of explanation. Run and explore it to see some decisions in designing the code. 

  * **guessNumber.c** was revised for this week. It now can read a name containing more than 1 word. Give it an 1-minute trial, just to understand a bit more about scanf.

 

------------------------------------------------------
HOWTO download this repository to your computer:

If you just want a single file, say, `e2x.c`:
  * Click `e2x.c` and you will see its markup content
  * Click `Raw` to get the coresponding text-only content 
  * Copy the content and paste into your grok/jEdit window


If you want to download the whole directory:
  * Download this whole directory by clicking `Clone or Download` --> `Download ZIP`, it will normally be downloaded to your `Downloads` folder under the name `c205-master` or `c205-master.ZIP`
  * Then copy or move the folder `c205-master` from `Downloads` to under your working folder
  * If the downloaded `c205-master` has the extension `.ZIP`, you likely need to expand the zipped file with command `unzip c205-master.ZIP`. If the command doesn't work, ask Google how to unzip.
