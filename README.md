 c205 Week 03:
=======
The lab's tasks today:
  * Mandatory task: implement ex. 3.6, then ask one of the tutors for any possible improvement.
  * Another task: implement ex 3.7. Read the task, and at first ask yourself: How many input data are needed? How many output data? What is the data type for each of them?
  * Still confused with `scanf`? Use file `scanf_test.c` to play a bit (by running it with some odd data and try to understand the output).
  * Do other exercises in `C03`, then `C04` of `grok`

  * Note: `play.c` can be used during the tutorial time. The easiest way is to use it in `Visual Studio`. But if you still haven't installed VS, or you still don't know how to use, you'd better to use the `Play Ground` of `grok`.
  
------------------------------------------------------
HOWTO download this repository to your computer:

If you just want a single file, say, `play.c`:
  * Click on `play.c` and you will see its content 
  * Copy the content and paste into your jEdit/editor window, then save it in your working folder

If you want to download the whole directory:
  * Download this whole directory by clicking `Clone or Download` --> `Download ZIP`, it will normally be downloaded to your `Downloads` folder under the name `c205-master` or `c205-master.ZIP`
  * Then copy or move the folder `c205-master` from `Downloads` to under your working folder
  * If the downloaded `c205-master` has the extension `.ZIP`, you likely need to expand the zipped file with command `unzip c205-master.ZIP`. If the command doesn't work, ask Google how to unzip.
