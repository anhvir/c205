 c205 Week 02: Start your lab with login into `grok` and do the exercises there first.
=======

If you don't know how to use `grok`
---------------------------------
1. Open a new tab in your browser and login into **`grok`** --> **`COMP20005 2020 S1`** --> **`Continue`**  
1. Do exercise 1.02 (heloworld). If you don't see the exercise, click on the symbol on the left of **`Instructions`**, then choose **`Exercise 1.02`** under **`W02 Week 2 Workshop`**. You will see the problem 1.02 in the left windows. To do exercise 1.02:
   1. Type your program in the program (the top right) window
   1. Click on **`Run`** to run your program
   1. If you see any error message, try to understand and fix it, then go back to the previous step
   1. If your program runs, click on **`Mark`** to have the program marked automatically, then continue to edit/run/mark until getting the correct output.
1. If you still have difficulty in using **`grok`**, ask for help, or have a look at **`Canvas`** --> **`Working with grok, jEdit, and gcc`** --> **`Guide to Using grok`**
1. Do exercise 2.08 
1. Do exercise 2.04. 
1. Try **`guessNumber.c`**, then **`explained_guessNumber.c`**
1. **NEW:** **`02_C205_20S1.pdf`**: slides used in the workshops this week

The best way of using this page with **`grok`**
--------------------------------------------
  * Click on individual .c file, such as **`guessNumber.c`**
  * Then, you see the content of the file, but don't use it because it comes with some formating stuffs we don't want. Instead, click on **`Raw`**
  * Now, you are seeing the text-only version of the file, copy it to clipboard using `Ctrl-A` then `Ctrl-C`
  * Paste the copied content to the **`PlayGround`** of **`grok`**
  * Run, mark, modify, rerun, ... 

The best way to use this page with **`jEdit`**/**`gc`c**
--------------------------------------------------
  * Download this whole **`c205`** directory by clicking **`Clone or Download`** --> **`Download ZIP`**, it will normally be downloaded to your `Downloads` directory
  * Then copy the directory `**c205**` from `**Downloads**` to your working directory
  * Now use **`jEdit`** and **`gcc`** to edit and try the program (if you haven't 
installed **`jEdit/gcc`** in your laptop, do it at home and try at home)
  * Note that **`explained_guessNumber.c`** is the same as **`guessNumber.c`**, but also has heap of explainations, but don't try hard to understand everything 
  * Repair and complete **`equation.c`** if you haven't done so 

Important Homework
-----------------
1. If you haven't installed **`minGW/jEdit`** on your laptop, do it at home ASAP and within this week. Instruction for installation is available in Canvas: 
**`Canvas`** -->  **`Working with grok, jEdit, and gcc`** --> **`Install gcc and jEdit on Your Own Computer`**
1. Remember: **`grok`** is a web interface, and you cannot use it offline. In addition, **`grok`** probably does not support full functionality of a programming environment. As a professional, you will need **`jEdit/gcc`**. You will need them for the comimg assignments. Install them today!
