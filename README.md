 c205 Week 04:
=======
  * **quiz.c** let you redo the quiz we did today! Compile and run it, and you can test
if you fully understood the quiz.
  * e2x.c is the same as it was last week, but I added the answers to all questions!!!
  * **guessNumber.c** was revised for this week. It now can read a name containing more than 1 word. NOTE: when it requires us to enter a number for the next input, if you try to type in some *letters* instead of *digits* the program still fails.
  Can we deal with that? Of course yet, but it's a bit complicated for now, and is not worth to invest our time. Final dot for guessNumber.c.
